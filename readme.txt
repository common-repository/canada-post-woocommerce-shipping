The Ultimate Canada Post WooCommerce Shipping Plugin. Dynamic Shipping Rates, Shipment Creation, Label and Invoice/Manifest Printing

== Description ==

= Introduction =

Canada Post WooCommerce Shipping plugin helps WooCommerce shops to streamline Canada Post shipping integration. This plugin helps you to get shipping rates from Canada Post APIs based on product weight, post code and other relevant details. Based on the postal codes and other parameters, all available shipping services along with the rates are listed for the customers to choose from.

To make the life of shop owners easier, Canada Post WooCommerce Shipping plugin automates the backend activities. With the click of a button on Wordpress dashboard, you can create new shipping and print the shipping label. You can also fetch manifest/invoice and print them. The plugin also enables sending of shipping status notifications to the customer email.

= Integrates WooCommerce to Canada Post =

Once this plugin is installed and configured with necessary information (please visit installation section for more info), your WordPress/WooCommerce Shop will be ready to ship using Canada Post. This plugin will add Canada Post shipping method as one of the shipping methods in WooCommerce.

= Calculate shipping rates dynamically =

While checking out, a customer is presented with the available shipping services and the rates based on his/her postal code, product weight and dimensions. Customer can choose the best method that matches his requirements and proceed to payment.

= Create Shipment and Print Shipping labels from WordPress admin =

Once an order is received, you can create the shipment with Canada Post from the order page on the admin side. Once shipment is created you can transmit the shipment to Canada Post. 

Note: Don't worry if you get an error saying that Fetch Manifest Failed. You can retry it by clicking 'Fetch Manifest'

You can now view the order and use the button   Print Label  to print the label which can be attached to the shipping boxes. Without this feature the owner has to log in to the Canada Post website each time he/she want to print the label.

Shipment will be split into multiple shipment if the order falls above the max weight configured in the settings. In this case, multiple  Print Label  buttons will appear on the order page.

= Fetch and print Manifest/Invoice from WordPress Admin =

Canada Post WooCommerce Shipping plugin adds a  Print Invoice  button in the order page in the WordPress admin. This will print the manifest/invoice which is your hard-copy proof of payment required for all shipments for pickup or drop-off to Canada Post.

Without this feature the owner has to log in to the Canada Post website each time he/she want to print the manifest/invoice.

= Enables automatic notifications =

Customers will get automatic email notifications about the status of their shipment.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Do I need a Canada Post Account to use this plugin..? =
Yes. The Canada Post WooCommerce Shipping plugin will require a Canada Post Account and the Account Details(Merchant User Name, Merchant Password) to get the shipping rates based on the services that are enabled for that account. The plugin also supports both Contract Rates as well as Non-Contract Rates.

= Does this plugin support all the shipping services from Canada Post..? =

= Can I display the estimated delivery dates to my customers..? = 
Yes. The plugin supports estimated delivery date and you can provide the delivery delay to display a range of days when the order will be delivered.

= Currently during checkout all shipping services from Canada Post are displayed. Can I disable few of them? =
Yes, you can surely disable the services based on your preference without any problems. 

= Currently I have not measured or weighed my products. Can I still get rates? =
It is mandatory to put in product weight and dimensions while fetching the rates. =

= My rates are coming as multiples of the item quantity. If I keep 2 items in cart, then the rate is getting doubled? Why is that happening?
The basic version is meant for small shop-owners who have 1 or 2 products in their inventory. Hence packing happens individually. In the premium plugin, there are additional packing methodologies like box packing, weight based packing using which you can get the rates for multiple items without any problems.

= Will your Canada Post & USPS plugins work smoothly together to have both shipping options available for customer to choose from? =
Yes. You are absolutely right. Both will work mutually exclusive and customer will be presented with both shipping options to choose from. Hope it clarifies.

= I am not getting the rates from the plugin = 
No worries. Just go to plugin settings page, enable the debug option. Once the debug is enabled, go to cart and place an order. In the cart page, you will see the request and response information. Copy them and send it to our support so that we can help you.

= Can I use this plugin only for Print label and charge the customers a flat rate I set? =
No. The basic version is meant for fetching real time rates. You can use our premium plugin for Print label and charge your own rate for shipping.

= I am not able to tracking my shipments using the plugin? =
Using the basic plugin, it is not possible to track your shipments. The basic plugin is used for fetching rates from the Canada Post API. Tracking and label generation are available in the our premium plugin.
